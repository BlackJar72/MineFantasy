# API ...?

I'm not quite sure what to do with this.  Should these be integrated 
into the MF3 API?  Or should the be peculiar to the mobs package and 
not given API representation at all? -- i.e., should these just be 
under entity?

These things are here for now, but might be moved with later 
refactoring.
