# MineFantasy III Mobs

An attempt to update MineFantasy I and MineFantasy II mobs for use with MineFantasy III in 
Minecraft 1.12.2.

Nothing new is planned at first, just get the old mobs working.

Later on, a few new mobs may be added, including steeds (upgraded horses), cave bears (drakes of the forest), 
and some huntable animals (spawn / despawn like monsters) for those players who prefer not to play farmers 
and for renewable prey for the hungry traveller.

Intially planned mobs: Drake, Minotaur, Basilisk, Skeletal Knight, Hound, and (maybe) Ddragons.

Later: Possibly add the MineFantasy II upgrades to vanilla mobs, including zombie knights.

Possible future mobs: Steed (suggested by AnonymousProductions), Cave Bear, Dear, Boars, lich, special undead.
